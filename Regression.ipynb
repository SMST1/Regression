        "\n",
        "For Simple Linear Regression to provide reliable and accurate predictions, certain assumptions must be met:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) should be linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that the change in Y is proportional to the change in X.\n",
        "\n",
        "Check: Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Independence of Errors (No Autocorrelation)\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals (errors) should not be correlated with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is especially important for time series data (where past values might influence future values).\n",
        "\n",
        "Check: Use the Durbin-Watson test to detect autocorrelation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "\n",
        "The variance of residuals should remain constant across all values of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "If errors grow or shrink as X increases, the model may not be reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Check: Plot residuals against X (should show a random spread, not a pattern).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Residuals\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals (differences between predicted and actual values) should be normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assumption is crucial for making valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.\n",

        "5. No Perfect Multicollinearity (Only for Multiple Regression)\n",
        "\n",
        "In Simple Linear Regression, there is only one independent variable, so this assumption is usually not an issue.\n",
